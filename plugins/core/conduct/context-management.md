# Context Management

Adapted from the strategic compaction pattern. Applies to all AI-assisted coding sessions.

## Compact at logical breakpoints

Trigger a context compaction (`/compact`, `/clear`, or equivalent) at natural transition points rather than waiting for automatic compaction at high context usage.

Good breakpoints:

- After research/exploration, before implementation begins.
- After completing a milestone, before starting the next task.
- After debugging, before continuing feature work.
- After a failed approach, before trying a different one.
- After a long planning discussion, before writing code.

Bad breakpoints:

- Mid-implementation — variable names, file paths, partial state, and decision rationale are lost.
- During a multi-step refactor with uncommitted intermediate changes.
- While iterating on a failing test — the error context is still needed.

## Minimize context consumption

- Do not load entire large files when only a section is needed — use line ranges or search.
- Prefer targeted reads (specific functions, specific line ranges) over full-file reads.
- When multiple files are needed, read only the relevant sections of each.
- Close or stop referencing files that are no longer relevant to the current task.

## MCP and tool discipline

- Each enabled MCP tool description consumes context tokens even if never invoked.
- Disable unused MCP servers per project rather than running all servers globally.
- Keep active tool count reasonable — prefer fewer, well-chosen tools over a large surface.

## Session boundaries

- Treat unrelated tasks as separate sessions — clear context between them.
- When a session becomes long and unfocused, summarize progress and start fresh.
- Before compacting, ensure any critical decisions or findings are recorded outside the session (commit messages, plan files, comments).
